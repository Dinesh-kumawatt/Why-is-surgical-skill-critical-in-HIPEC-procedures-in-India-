HIPEC (heated intra‑abdominal chemotherapy) adds complexity to cytoreductive surgery. Dr. Singhal shows why surgeon skill is the key survival factor 

Completeness of tumor removal: Optimal cytoreduction (no visible disease) directly correlates with survival.

Operative precision: Skill prevents complications like leaks, bleeding, and organ injury during HIPEC’s thermal phase.

Team coordination: Requires tight collaboration among oncology, anesthesia, nursing. Experience improves efficiency and safety.

Case volume: High-volume HIPEC teams report complication rates under 30% and 5-year survival outcomes above national averages.
Dr. Singhal’s center uses HPC-trained staff, structured protocols, and data tracking—making surgical quality the cornerstone of better survival in HIPEC.
